# CCTVPi_Network

## Introduction and Motivation
This project has been one of our projects during the studies at the UAS FH Technikum Wien. The implementation of this project relies on the ideas gathered from the Workshop in Embedded Software.
The here presented implementation contains some of the methods already implemented.
However, the rest of the functionality has been implemented on my very own.
